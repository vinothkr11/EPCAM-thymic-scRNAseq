The current repository consists of scRNAseq analysis of single cell data from EpCam+ sorted mouse Thymic Epithelial Fibroblast, where 6 samples were hash tagged using Totalseq A HashTag antibodies and combined together for a single run in 10x chromium. The GEX was preprocessed with cellranger 8.0 and the CiteSeq data was preprocessed using Cite-Seq-Count. Both analysis yielded matrix files that is being used to create a Seurat object.
